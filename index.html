        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>The following recipe for red beans and rice is a homemade dish passed down from my grandmother to my mother and now to me. It's a traditional dish that features the primary ingredient, red beans and rice, alongside New Orleans style spices, sausage, and ham flavoring. The dish brings to life the satisfying taste of New Orleans Southern Style along with easy to prep rice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients for Pot</h2>

            <li>1 pound dry red beans or 3-4 cans of red kidney beans</li>
            <li>ham bone or ham seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worchestershire</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves garlic chopped</li>

            <li>Water</li> 
            <li>14 oz. Andouille sausage or smoked sausage</li>
            <li>3 TBsp vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients for Roux</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 TBsp flour</li>
            <li>1 small-medium onion chopped</li>
            <li>1 small green bell pepper chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks of celery chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 green onions</li>
            <li>rice</li>
        </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Empty cans of beans into large pot. Add the next ham bone, worchestershire, garlic, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, black pepper, white pepper, creole seasoning, and crab boil. Add water to cover beans by about an inch.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and boil about 2-3 minutes then lower heat to simmer stirring occasionally. Be sure to stir so beans don’t burn or stick to bottom of pot.</li>
        <li>Add sausage and stir. Continue to cook about 20 minutes while you do the following:</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in skillet over medium high heat. Using a whisk add flour and whisk continually until flour becomes the color of light peanut butter. Keep stirring so flour doesn’t burn. This is the roux which will thicken the sauce of the beans.</li>
        <li>To the roux in skillet add the chopped onion, celery, green bell pepper, and green onion and cook stirring and turning until onions, pepper, celery become softer. You don’t have to cook them very long.</li>
        <li>Dump it all into the pot with the beans. Stir until well blended. The longer it all simmers the more the flavors will blend together to make delicious red beans. Just be sure to stir often while simmering.</li>
        <li>Cook rice per directions and serve beans over rice.</li>
    </ol>
