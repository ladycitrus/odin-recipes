        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>The following recipe for red beans and rice is a homemade dish passed down from my grandmother to my mother and now to me. It's a traditional dish that features the primary ingredient, red beans and rice, alongside New Orleans style spices, sausage, and ham flavoring. The dish brings to life the satisfying taste of New Orleans Southern Style along with easy to prep rice.</p>
